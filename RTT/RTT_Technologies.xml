<!-- TECH TREE REDESIGN QUICK GUIDE
TECH PLACEMENT ON SCREEN
Tree Column is automatically assigned based on Era and cost.
Tree Rows are a -3 to 4 index with -3 at the top of the screen, 0 in the middle, and 4 at the bottom.
The Rows can be modified in the <Technologies> section.
	<Update> <Where TechnologyType="TECH_NAME"/> <Set UITreeRow="0"/> </Update>
